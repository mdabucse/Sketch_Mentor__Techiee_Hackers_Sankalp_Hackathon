    "0": "Hi students, this is Alex here. In this question, they have given the probability density function of random variable x is f of x which is kx and 0 less than x less than 1. In the first part we have to find k and second part we have to find p of x greater than 0.5. To find k, we are going to use a condition integral minus infinity to infinity f of x dx equal to 1, where it is a probability density function. So, here the function exists from 0 to 1. So, limit is from 0 to 1. For f of x, we take kx dx and we equate this to 1. Integration of x is x square by 2 and we have to use the limit and equate to 1. When I use upper limit, it is 1 by 2 and it is lower limit it is 0. So, from this the value of k we get",
    "1": "is 2. So, if we need the first part, coming to the second part, they want from 0.5 till 1 because when p is p of x is greater than 0.5, this from 0.5 till the maximum width we have the function is 1. And now the function is kx, but k is 2 and we take x. We are going to evaluate this. Its integration is 2 x square by 2. We can cancel this 2 and 2 and we have 0.5 till 1. So, when I put the upper limit it is 1 square minus when I put the lower limit it is 0.5 square. So, totally this is 1 minus 0.25 after subtraction we get 0.75."
