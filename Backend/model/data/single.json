    "0": "Pi is delicious. The other kind of pi is a number, which is the ratio of the outside of a circle, the circumference of a circle to the diameter of a circle. So it's a kind of a miraculous thing about circles that no matter how big or small the circle is, Pi is always the same. Mathematicians have spent time calculating digits of pi for thousands of years. Pi is an irrational number, so the decimal places go on forever without ever repeating themselves. And nowadays we can calculate billions and billions of digits. Pi is crucial in math for many reasons, because you can't really do anything with circles if you don't know about pi. And circles are everywhere, because every time you have a curved thing and a straight thing, in order for them to interact, there is some pi going on. Nature doesn't like always going in a straight line, because sometimes things interact.",
    "1": "If you throw a ball in the air, it's not going to go in a straight line, it's going to go in a curve. And curves and straight lines are difficult to make interact without pi. And if you look around you, even if you're in an extremely abon-godly square room, there are still going to be processes going on, things moving, the electricity, all of those things happen in things that aren't really straight lines, and pi is likely to be involved."
