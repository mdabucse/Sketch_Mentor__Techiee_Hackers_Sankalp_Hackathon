def generate_process_structure(process):
    prompt = f"""
Act as an expert Python programmer specializing in the Manim Community Edition (manimce) and an algorithm visualization specialist.

{process}

Your task is to generate a comprehensive, complete Python script using manimce that animates *every significant step* of the following algorithm:

*Algorithm to Visualize: {process}*

You must also generate a synchronized, detailed, step-by-step *voiceover script* that matches the Manim animation.

---

### ‚úÖ MANIM CODE REQUIREMENTS:

1. Provide **complete code** with necessary imports, class structure, and a fully implemented `construct` method.
2. Ensure the animation lasts **at least 90 seconds**, with thoughtful pacing and clear transitions.
3. Animate the algorithm with:
    - Nodes (using Circle + Text)
    - Edges (using Line or Arrow)
    - Labels, Highlights, and Text Annotations
    - Transitions between logical steps using sub-scenes or grouping

4. Visual elements to show:
    - Initialization
    - Iterative or Recursive Steps
    - State Changes (e.g., color changes, stack updates)
    - Backtracking or Termination
    - Optional: Show **two versions** of the algorithm (e.g., Recursive DFS and Iterative DFS)

5. Add **Text annotations** such as "Visiting Node A", "Backtracking", etc. Use:
    - `.scale(0.5)` or smaller for long text to avoid overlap
    - `text.set(width=X)` or `text.scale_to_fit_width(X)` to wrap long lines automatically
    - Position texts to avoid edges (use `to_edge()` or `shift()` smartly)
    - When multiple texts accumulate and reach screen borders, **remove all previous texts using `FadeOut` or `self.clear()` before showing new ones**

6. Consistent **color coding**:
    - YELLOW for current node
    - RED for backtracking
    - GREEN for completed
    - BLUE or GRAY for unvisited/default state

7. Include timing:
    - Use `run_time` for all animations
    - Add `self.wait()` between steps for pacing
    - Ensure animation timing matches the narration

### üéôÔ∏è VOICEOVER SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:

1. Start with a brief *introduction* to the algorithm and its use case.
2. Narrate *each visual step* clearly and simply.
3. Use teaching-style phrases:
    - "Now we visit..."
    - "Watch as we highlight..."
    - "Notice how the node turns yellow to indicate..."
    - "Here‚Äôs what backtracking looks like..."
4. At the end, give a short *summary*, and mention if an alternate version was shown.

---

### ‚ú® Output Format:
- Provide the Python animation code in a ```python block.
- Follow with the voiceover script under a heading like:

## Voiceover Script:

Be verbose, structured, and assume your audience are beginner learners.
