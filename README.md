## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Canvas AI

Our system offers a dedicated math canvas for writing equations and diagrams that the AI instantly solves with step-by-step guidance. A RAG-based chatbot delivers context-aware answers from video transcripts, while a video transcriber powered by OpenAI Whisper converts audio into searchable text.

### 🎥 Video Generation

Simply provide the algorithm's name or description, and our system automatically creates all the necessary visuals—shapes, parameters, and diagrams—along with a step-by-step text animation to explain it clearly.

### 📊 Visualizer

Our real-time equation visualizer converts your equations into dynamic, interactive graphs, allowing you to explore the behavior of functions as they evolve. It highlights key features like intercepts, slopes, and curvature, offering a clear, intuitive way to understand and analyze complex mathematical relationships.

### ⚙️ Interactive Solver

Our interactive solver provides comprehensive, step-by-step solutions using both text and images. It details every stage of the process, explaining what to do, how to perform each step, and showcasing the output at every point, making it easy to follow along and understand the solution.
